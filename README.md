# Rock, Paper, Scissors

##### 2/3/2023 - Console RPS

Submission for [TOP - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). Tried applying different types of conditionals (if/else, switch, ternary operators). Took some time to figure out how to prompt for player input again if they didn't enter rock, paper, or scissors.

##### 2/5/2023 - Added JS Interactivity

Took a while to figure out the logic for a seemingly simple game. Code works, but is cluttered with if/else statements, forEach, and adding a 'hidden' class. Learned the power of pseudocode in helping to figure out what functions to create / call. Will now check out a tutorial and other people's code.
