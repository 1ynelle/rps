# Rock, Paper, Scissors

##### 2/3/2023 - Console RPS

Submission for [TOP - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). Tried applying different types of conditionals (if/else, switch, ternary operators). Took some time to figure out how to prompt for player input again if they didn't enter rock, paper, or scissors.

##### 2/4/2023 - Added CSS

Practiced using flexbox and CSS positioning! Still need to figure out how to make the desk in the background fill up available bottom space on scroll. Also need to improve scorecards and player board design for 320px screen.

##### 2/5/2023 - Added JS Interactivity

Took a while to figure out the logic for a seemingly simple game. Code works, but is cluttered with if/else statements, forEach, and adding a 'hidden' class. Learned the power of pseudocode in helping to figure out what functions to create / call. Forced me to really clarify what it is I want to create and to break that down step by step... Next step is to clean up the code with a tutorial!
