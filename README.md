# Rock, Paper, Scissors

###### 2/3/2023 - Console RPS

Submission for [TOP - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). Tried applying different types of conditionals (if/else, switch, ternary operators). Took some time to figure out how to prompt for player input again if they didn't enter rock, paper, or scissors.
